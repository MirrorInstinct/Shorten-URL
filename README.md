### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This was one of the most challenging projects I have taken on. I learned a few new things about Javascript such as promises, fetch and react overall. This project boosted my 
web dev skills to a level that I never thought I could reach before.

### Continued development

In the future, I will continue to work on my React skills especially and try to utilize more of React's features.

### Useful resources
